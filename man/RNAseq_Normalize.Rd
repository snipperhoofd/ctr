\title{Normalized RNAseq raw read counts}
\usage{
RNAseq_Normalize(RNAseq_Annotated_Matrix, matrix_features, method = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{RNAseq_Annotated_Matrix}{The original count matrix (See X for format details).}

\item{matrix_features}{General_features object that contains various metrics about the RNAseq data in the matrix.
                         the values SS, SE and sample_names are used, together with  no_feature, ambiguous and not_aligned. A set of vectors equal to the number of samples,
containing the number of reads that had no feature,
where ambiguously mapped, or not aligned in their  (obtained from the mapping output).}

\item{method}{A string containing the method to use, either one of: ["default", "TMM", "RLE"].  In addition to the described default method, TMM and RLE from bioconductors edgeR
package are implemented as well}

\item{gene_lengths}{<NOT IMPLEMENTED> A matrix with the length of each gene (genes must be in same order as input RNAseq_Annotated_Matrix)}
}
\value{
The normalized read counts  of \code{Sample 1} ... \code{Sample N}.
}
\description{
RNAseq raw read counts may by normalized based on various parameters including reads per sample,
reads mapped per genome, gene length, log2 RPKM
}
\note{
\preformatted{To remove rows that have a 0 for its read counts:}
\code{RNAseq_Annotated_Matrix[apply(RNAseq_Annotated_Matrix[, SS:SE], 1, function(x) !any(x == 0)), ]}
\preformatted{Where SS and SE are the start and end columns of the samples (raw counts).}
