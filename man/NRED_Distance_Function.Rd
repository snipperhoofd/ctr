\title{Calculates pairwise NRED for a module}
\usage{
NRED_Distance_Function(Subset_KOs)
}
\arguments{
\item{Subset_KOs}{A list of KOs that form a module}
}
\value{
a list of vectors containing pairwise NRED scores (nred), their Z-scores (Zscore), 
and the position in the matrix for the highest scoring pair between genomes A and B 
(positionA & positionB respectively)
}
\description{
This function calculates all pairwise NRED for a given module. When two genomes contain multiple
elements for comparison, this is handled either by takng a random pairwise comparison, 
or by taking the score with the maximum similarity. A background distribution using each method
is provided for comparison. (Currently it only provides the score that minimizes the distances)
}
\examples{
PHA_module_NRED <- NRED_Distance_Function(PHA_module)
}
